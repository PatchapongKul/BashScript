Internet of things

The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects 
(or groups of such objects) that are embedded with sensors, 
processing ability, software, and other technologies that 
connect and exchange data with other devices and systems 
over the Internet or other communications networks.

The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, 
including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly 
powerful embedded systems, and machine learning.[1] Traditional 
fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, 
automation (including home and building automation), independently and 
collectively enable the Internet of things. In the consumer market, 
IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the 
concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances 
(such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and 
cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more 
common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated 
with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. 
The IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.[5]

There are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of 
IoT technologies and products, especially in the areas of privacy 
and security, and consequently, industry and governmental moves to 
address these concerns have begun, including the development of 
international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.
