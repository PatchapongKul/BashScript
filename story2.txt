Linux

Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the 
Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms 
than any other operating system.[22] Because of the dominance of the 
Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux also has the largest installed 
base of all general-purpose operating systems.[23][24][25][26] Although 
Linux is used by only around 2.3 percent of desktop computers,[27][28] 
the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS, dominates 
the US Kâ€“12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of 
sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[29] Linux is the leading operating 
system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' 
operating systems are Linux),[30] leads other big iron systems such as 
mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers 
(since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors).
